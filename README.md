# ETC

This repository contains the original source map files for my Half-Life mod [ETC](https://www.johnsto.co.uk/design/personal/#hl-etc). Some maps use custom textures and/or sounds which are supplied with the ETC release and can be downloaded [here](https://www.johnsto.co.uk/files/hl/djetc.zip).

The "cut" folder includes a bunch of maps that I had designed for ETC, but didn't make it into the final release.

Anyone is permitted to use these maps and textures in their own projects provided credit is given. A link to [my website](https://www.johnsto.co.uk) and/or this repository would be appreciated so others may see the original files.
